## Crowdfunding Platform

This Crowdfunding Platform is a decentralized web application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create and fund projects using cryptocurrencies. This project was built as part of my learning journey in Web3 and Solidity, offering hands-on experience with blockchain development.

- This platform[project] was developed, while learning & exploring  Web3 technologies and  Solidity. Future improvements could include multi-network support, adding more blockchain features, or integrating different wallet providers.
